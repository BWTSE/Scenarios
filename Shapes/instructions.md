# Shapes Task

Your task is to extend this shapes library with a class for a square pyramid, i.e. a pyramid with the base of a square.

The new class should implement the interface `Shape3D` and have the following constructor: `SquarePyramid(double baseSideLength, double height)` 

Feel free to modify the existing codebase in any way you want as long as you maintain existing functionality.
