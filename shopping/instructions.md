# Shopping task

This system represents a shopping basket tracker, e.g. at the self scanning stations that are common in grocery stores.

Your task is to add a class that represents a receipt. The class should have a method that returns a string that, when printed, looks somewhat like what you would get at a store.
The Tracker class should have a method that generates a receipt object based on what is currently "in the basket".

Finally, call your new methods (and print the receipt to the console) from Main.

The "ItemDatabase" class (crudely) mocks database access, pay little attention to it. Otherwise you are free to modify the existing system, if you feel it is appropriate to complete your task.
